### Validator staking pool requirements 

There are minimum staking requirements a validator must satisfy to become active and to stay in the active validator set.

#### Current requirements

- A validator candidate must accrue at least 30M SUI of stake before they can request to join the validator set.
- If an active validator's stake falls below 20M SUI, they have seven epochs of grace period to gain back the stake before being removed from the validator set.
- If an active validator's stake falls below 15M SUI, they are removed from the validator set at the end of the current epoch boundary. Sui uses 24-hour epochs.

#### Upcoming changes with SIP-39

The Sui network is implementing SIP-39, which will significantly lower the barrier to entry for validators. Instead of requiring a minimum amount of SUI tokens, validators will need a minimum amount of *voting power*:

- The minimum requirement will change from a fixed SUI amount to a voting power threshold of 3 (out of 10,000 total voting power).
- This will substantially decrease the amount of SUI needed to join the validator set (approximately 3M SUI, with a settled V of 3).
- This change will be phased in gradually over three phases to ensure network stability.

#### Understanding the voting power formula

SIP-39 uses the following formula to determine if a validator can join the set:

```
S / (S + T) > V / 10000
```

Where:
- S = The validator candidate's stake amount
- T = Total amount already staked in the network
- V = Minimum voting power threshold (3 in the final phase)
- 10000 = Total voting power units in the Sui system

This formula checks if the validator would have at least V voting power after joining. Let's break it down:

1. S / (S + T) calculates what proportion of the total stake the validator would control
2. When multiplied by 10000, this gives their voting power in Sui's standardized units
3. The validator can join if this value is greater than or equal to the threshold V

For example, with a network stake of 7.69B SUI and V=3:
- A validator with 2.31M SUI would have: 2,310,000 / (2,310,000 + 7,694,950,773) ≈ 0.0003 proportion
- Converting to voting power: 0.0003 × 10000 ≈ 3 units
- Since 3 ≥ 3, they meet the threshold to join

As the total network stake changes, the minimum required amount will adjust automatically.
